"""Botcore development commands.

Commands are split into modules:
- core.py: lint, test, build, skill-lint (language-aware dispatch)
- quality.py: check-size, check-coverage, check-deps
- analysis.py: dead-code, circular-imports, unused-deps, dep-graph
- portability.py: check-paths (cross-platform path detection)
