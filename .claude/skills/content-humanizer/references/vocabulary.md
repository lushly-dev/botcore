- burgeoning -- use: growing, expanding

## Word Replacement Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Core Meaning

Ask: What is this word actually saying?

- "delve into" = look at closely
- "rich tapestry" = varied collection
- "navigate challenges" = deal with problems

### Step 2: Choose Concrete Alternative

Select based on:

- Specificity (prefer precise over general)
- Register (match formality to context)
- Rhythm (vary syllable counts)

### Step 3: Verify Natural Flow

Read the sentence aloud. Does it sound like something a human would say in conversation?

## Frequency Multiplier Sources
