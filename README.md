> 🟢 **Beta** · Stable and in active use across multiple repositories. APIs are mostly stable; expect targeted iterative improvements. Feedback welcome!

> **Reference pair:** botcore delivers shared command/skill infrastructure; AFD provides the command-first architecture contract those commands are designed to follow. See https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd.

**What happens when every repo needs great agent tooling?**

You build it in one project, copy it to the next. Maybe you symlink. Maybe you create junctions. The skills diverge. The commands drift. A fix in one repo never reaches the others. Before long, you're maintaining five slightly different agents across five repositories — same tools, different versions, different bugs.

botcore ends the drift. Shared bot infrastructure — commands, skills, configuration, and plugins — delivered as a single `pip install`. Plugins extend it per-project. Skill ownership tiers let central updates flow without overwriting local customizations. One package, every repo, always in sync.

---

## The Problem: Agent Drift

When you work across multiple repositories, each one needs capable agent tooling — linters, test runners, quality gates, skill libraries. The natural solution is copy-paste. And copy-paste creates drift.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Drift["Without botcore: Agent Drift"]
        direction TB
        A["📁 Repo A<br/><em>agent v1.2<br/>42 skills</em>"] ~~~ B["📁 Repo B<br/><em>agent v1.0<br/>38 skills</em>"]
        B ~~~ C["📁 Repo C<br/><em>agent v1.3<br/>45 skills</em>"]
        A -. "copy-paste" .-> B
        B -. "copy-paste" .-> C
    end

    style Drift fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style A fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style B fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style C fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
```

But the problem isn't just organizational. When these tools are exposed to AI agents via MCP, there's a second issue: **token overload**. An MCP server with 30+ commands means the agent loads 30+ tool schemas into its context window before doing any real work. Some models silently fail when the tool list gets too large.

## The Solution: Shared Infrastructure

botcore solves both problems at once. Centralize the infrastructure, then deliver it efficiently.

```mermaid
graph TB
    BC["📦 botcore<br/><em>pip install lushly-botcore</em>"]

    BC --> A["📁 Repo A"]
    BC --> B["📁 Repo B"]
    BC --> C["📁 Repo C"]

    P["🔌 Plugins"] --> BC
    S["📚 52 Skills"] --> BC
    CMD["⚡ 38+ Commands"] --> BC

    style BC fill:#16213e,stroke:#22c55e,stroke-width:2px,color:#eee
    style A fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style B fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style C fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style P fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#eee
    style S fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#8B5CF6,color:#eee
    style CMD fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#eee
```

Install once. Every repo gets the same commands, the same skills, the same quality gates. Plugins add project-specific extensions without touching the core. Skill ownership tiers (`botcore`, `plugin`, `local`) ensure updates propagate cleanly — central skills update automatically, local customizations are never overwritten.

## Token-Efficient by Design

Most MCP servers expose one tool per command. 30 commands = 30 tool schemas in the agent's context. botcore uses the **meta-tool pattern** to collapse everything into just 3 MCP tools, regardless of how many commands exist:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Traditional["Traditional: N Tools"]
        direction TB
        T1["🔧 dev_lint"] ~~~ T2["🔧 dev_test"]
        T2 ~~~ T3["🔧 dev_build"]
        T3 ~~~ T4["🔧 skill_seed"]
        T4 ~~~ TN["🔧 ...30 more"]
    end

    subgraph Botcore["botcore: 3 Meta-Tools"]
        direction TB
        S["🚀 start<br/><em>discover everything</em>"]
        D["📖 docs<br/><em>learn on demand</em>"]
        R["▶️ run<br/><em>execute anything</em>"]
    end

    style Traditional fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style T1 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style T2 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style T3 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style T4 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style TN fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#eee
    style Botcore fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style S fill:#16213e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style D fill:#16213e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style R fill:#16213e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
```

> **The meta-tool insight:** *Token cost should be O(1), not O(n). The agent discovers what's available, reads docs for what it needs, then executes — all through 3 stable tools, whether you have 10 commands or 100.*

The agent workflow becomes:

1. **`start`** — Returns version, available functions, and doc topics. The agent orients itself.
2. **`docs`** — Retrieves topic-based reference docs on demand. No upfront cost.
3. **`run`** — Executes any command. AST-validated, output-truncated (head + tail preserved within 8KB), safe.

One line creates the server:

```python
from botcore.server import create_mcp_server

server = create_mcp_server("mybot", version="1.0.0")
server.run(transport="stdio")
```

Adding a command to botcore or a plugin automatically makes it available — no hardcoded tool lists, no schema updates, no context window bloat.

## How It Works

    style Core fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#eee
    style Plugins fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#eee
    style Skills fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#8B5CF6,color:#eee

    style DC fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#22c55e,color:#eee
    style Seed fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#8B5CF6,color:#eee
```

Core commands and plugin commands merge into a single namespace. That namespace powers three surfaces — MCP, CLI, and DirectClient — from the same source. Skills are managed separately through the skill registry, which handles seeding, version tracking, linting, and ownership.

Language detection is automatic. botcore inspects workspace markers (`Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`) and dispatches to the right tools — ruff for Python, biome for TypeScript, clippy for Rust. No configuration required for the common case.

| **botcore** | `build-botcore-plugins`, `configure-botcore`, `run-dev-checks`, `automate-browsers` |

## Plugin System

Plugins extend botcore without modifying the core. The contract is a Python Protocol — no base class, no inheritance:

```python
class MyPlugin:
    def register(self, registry: PluginRegistry) -> None:
        registry.add_commands([my_command])
        registry.add_docs("myplugin", DOCS_STRING)
        registry.set_mcp_name("myplugin")
        registry.add_skills_dir(Path(__file__).parent / "skills")

    def config_schema(self):
        return MyPluginConfig  # Pydantic model or None
```

Register via entry point in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."botcore.plugins"]
myplugin = "myplugin.plugin:MyPlugin"
```

The plugin's commands, docs, and skills automatically appear in MCP, CLI, and DirectClient surfaces. No wiring. No hardcoded lists. Add a command to a plugin, and every bot that uses it gains the capability immediately.

## Skill Ownership

Skills use a `source:` field in YAML frontmatter to track ownership:

```yaml
---
name: security
source: botcore
description: Audit code for vulnerabilities.
version: "3.0.0"
triggers:
  - security
  - vulnerability
---
```

Three tiers:
- **`source: botcore`** — Bundled universal skills, updated by `skill_seed --update`
- **`source: <plugin>`** — Plugin-provided skills
- **No source / `source: local`** — Project-specific skills, never overwritten by seed

This solves the customization problem: central skills stay in sync across repos, while project-specific skills remain untouched.

## Configuration

Convention over configuration. An empty config is valid — language detection and tool defaults handle the common case. When you need control:

```toml
# botcore.toml or pyproject.toml [tool.botcore]

[skills]
include = ["security", "testing"]  # Only seed these (omit for all)
skip = ["i18n"]                    # Exclude these
source_dir = ".claude/skills"      # Target directory

[languages.python]
root = "python/"
linter = "ruff"
test_runner = "pytest"

[languages.typescript]
root = "packages/"
linter = "biome"
test_runner = "vitest"
```

Language resolution follows a 5-step priority chain: explicit override → root prefix match → per-package override → marker walk-up → primary fallback. Multi-language monorepos work out of the box.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install lushly-botcore

# From source (with dev + MCP extras)
pip install -e ".[dev,mcp]"
```

### Create an MCP Server

```python
from botcore.server import create_mcp_server

# One line — all commands, docs, and discovery wired automatically
server = create_mcp_server("mybot", version="1.0.0")
server.run(transport="stdio")
```

### Use Commands Directly

```python
from botcore import get_client

client = get_client()

# Language-aware — dispatches to ruff, biome, or clippy automatically
result = await client.call("dev_lint")

# Seed skills into the current repo
result = await client.call("skill_seed", {"update": True})
```

### Seed Skills

```bash
# Copy all 52 bundled skills into .claude/skills/
botcore skill-seed

# Check for version drift
botcore skill-status

# Lint skills for quality
botcore skill-lint
```

## Development

```bash
# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,mcp]"

# Run all tests (172+)
pytest tests/ -v

# Lint
ruff check src/

# Lint with auto-fix
ruff check src/ --fix
```
