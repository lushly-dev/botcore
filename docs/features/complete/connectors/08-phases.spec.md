# Phases & Acceptance Criteria Specification

> Part of [Typed Connectors Plan](./00-overview.plan.md)

## Overview

This meta-spec sequences the connector implementation across four phases, defines wave-level task breakdowns within each phase, establishes per-task acceptance criteria, documents the testing approach per phase, and sets the release versioning strategy. It aggregates the task breakdowns from individual specs ([01](./01-connector-base.spec.md)–[05](./05-github-connector.spec.md)) into a unified delivery plan.

## Requirements

### Phase Sequencing

- Phase 1 MUST be completed before any other phase begins
- Phases 2 and 3 MAY overlap if Phase 1 is complete, but Phase 2 SHOULD precede Phase 3
- Phase 4 MUST NOT begin until Phase 3 is complete (depends on Graph auth patterns)
- Each phase MUST pass its validation criteria before the next phase starts

### Testing Approach

- Every connector command MUST have unit tests with mocked HTTP responses
- Every phase MUST include integration tests validating the end-to-end flow: command → middleware → auth → mocked API → `CommandResult`
- Phase 1 MUST include scenario tests using AFD `afd.testing` for GitHub workflows
- Error paths MUST be tested: auth failure, rate limiting, not found, validation errors
- Security invariants MUST be verified per phase: no token leakage, scope enforcement, input validation

### Release Versioning

- Phase 1 SHOULD release as `botcore-connectors` v0.1.0
- Phase 2 SHOULD release as v0.2.0
- Phase 3 SHOULD release as v0.3.0
- Phase 4 MAY release as v0.4.0 or be deferred
- Major version 1.0 SHOULD NOT be released until at least Phases 1-3 are stable in production

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: GitHub Connector (Foundation)

#### Wave 1.1: Package & Base

| Task | Spec | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Create `botcore-connectors` package scaffold | [03](./03-config-and-plugin.spec.md) | `pip install -e .` succeeds; entry-point resolves |
| Define `ConnectorContext` model | [01](./01-connector-base.spec.md) | Validates with defaults; rejects invalid values |
| Implement `_api_call` with middleware | [01](./01-connector-base.spec.md) | HTTP request flows through telemetry → logging → rate limit → retry → client |
| Implement HTTP→error code mapping | [01](./01-connector-base.spec.md) | Every status code in spec table maps to correct error code |

#### Wave 1.2: Auth & Config

| Task | Spec | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Implement GitHub auth chain | [02](./02-auth.spec.md) | Resolves from env var; falls back to CLI; returns error when both fail |
| Implement token cache | [02](./02-auth.spec.md) | Second resolve returns cached; expires after TTL |

| Log sanitization for bearer tokens | [02](./02-auth.spec.md) | No token strings in any log output |
| GitHub rate limit header handling | [05](./05-github-connector.spec.md) | Pauses on `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` |

### Phase 4: DevOps Connectors (Deferred)

- [ ] Azure Service Bus send/receive/peek/complete work
- [ ] `DefaultAzureCredential` chain resolves auth
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] v0.2.0 released

### Phase 3 Gate

## Rollback Plan

Each phase is independently rollback-able:

1. **Phase rollback:** Remove the connector modules added in that phase; decrement version
2. **Full rollback:** Remove the `botcore-connectors` package entirely
3. **Version pinning:** Downstream consumers can pin to the last known-good version (e.g., `botcore-connectors==0.1.0`)
4. No existing botcore functionality depends on connectors — removal is always safe
